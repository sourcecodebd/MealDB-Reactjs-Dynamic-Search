Hi! This time I have modified my previous version of MealDB React app.  I implemented search dynamically setting searched text into API URL. This was a simple food API related app using React JS, JavaScript, CSS3, Bootstrap. Here People can search food by name, click to check information. Carousel has been used in this project. Check it out now!
